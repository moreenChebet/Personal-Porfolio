    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <P>
        My name is Maurine Chebet. Software developer, graphic designer and technical trainer by proffession.<br>
        I train kids & teens on how to code, be safe online, digital literacy and web development. <br>
        In this digital age, some parents and caregivers navigate the challenges faced by ignoring them.<br> 
        This however presents a temporary solution to a permanent problem. <br>
        For this case, I chip in by training them on ways of solving those challenges.<br>
        I cover various technology related issues that affect our day to day lives with the goals being:
        <ol> 
            <li>Creating awareness on the benefits of technology</li> 
            <li>Elaborating on disasters that can result when technology is misused</li> 
            <li>Online safety</li>
        </ol>    

    </P>
